# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system. 
It uses a machine learning approach (implemented in a Jupyter Notebook) to suggest movies to users. <br>
A Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the recommendation system. <br>

## Key Components:

### Recommendation System <br>
#### ipynb: <br> 
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code that:<br>
Loads and preprocesses movie data (likely from a dataset like the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset).Calculates a similarity matrix between movies based on features like genre, keywords, cast, and crew.Generates movie recommendations based on these similarity calculations.
Saves the processed data and similarity matrix for use in the Streamlit app. <br>
#### app.py:<br>
This is a Streamlit web application that: <br>
Loads the processed movie data and similarity matrix generated by the Jupyter Notebook.
Allows users to select a movie from a list.
Uses the recommendation logic (from the Notebook) to find similar movies.
Displays the recommended movies along with their posters (fetched from the Movie Database API). <br>
In essence: The Notebook builds the recommendation model, and the Streamlit app makes it interactive for users.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommendation-System.git](https://github.com/jnishanjain/Movie-Recommendation-System.git)
    cd Movie-Recommendation-System
    ```
2.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
